## ✅ Step 1: Create the NAT Network in VirtualBox

This is a one-time setup.

1. Open **VirtualBox**.
2. Go to **File** → **Tools** → **Network Manager**.
3. Click the **NAT Networks** tab.
4. Click **Create**.
   - You’ll get something like `NatNetwork`.
   - Confirm IPv4 Prefix is `10.0.2.0/24`.
   - Enable network.
5. This acts as a **virtual router** for your cluster.

## ✅ Step 2: Configure Your Ubuntu VMs

We're assuming two VMs: `ubuntu-head` (head node), `ubuntu-node1` (compute node).

### 🖧 Step 2.1: Attach VMs to the `NAT Network` not `NAT`

1. For each VM → **Settings** → **Network** → **Adapter 1**:
   - Enable adapter.
   - Attached to: `NAT Network`. NB: this is not `NAT`
   - Name: `NatNetwork`. `NB:` this is what you **created** on `step 1`
   

### 🔐 Step 2.2: Install SSH Server on Each VM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh --now
```

### 🌐 Step 2.3: Get IP Addresses

Run on each VM:

```bash
ip a
```

Note the `inet` address under `enp0s3` (e.g., `10.0.2.4`, `10.0.2.5`).

### 📶 Step 2.4: Test Connectivity - `Within your cluster`

From `head`, test ping and SSH to `node1`:
NB: you cannot ssh to `node1` if is not up yet.

```bash
ping 10.0.2.5
ssh your_username@10.0.2.5
```

## ✅ Step 3: Set Up Port Forwarding (Host → VM)

### Port Mappings

- Host `2222` → `head:22`
- Host `2223` → `node1:22`

### In VirtualBox

1. **File** → **Tools** → **Network Manager** → `NatNetwork` → **Port Forwarding**
2. Add 2 rules: use the `green`plus sign➕, on the right
   - leave the `host ip` blank:
      - `head-ssh`: Host Port `2222`, Guest IP `10.0.2.4`, Guest Port `22`
      - `node1-ssh`: Host Port `2223`, Guest IP `10.0.2.5`, Guest Port `22`

   To test if they are working, use you host(`Windows machine`) terminal in the `next step`
---

## ✅ Step 4: SSH from Host to VMs

From host terminal: Open `Powershell` on you windows machine(Host)

**NB: We are testing"**
Test if you can ssh to `head` and `node1` from your windows machine(Host) using `Powershell`

```bash
ssh your_username@127.0.0.1 -p 2222  # head >> if successful, type exit
ssh your_username@127.0.0.1 -p 2223  # node1 >> if successful, type exit
```
**Results**
* If you where able to *ssh* to both machine, you in **good** track ✅ 
* If NOT😒, please go to `step 2.1` & redo it 🔁, on the instance you cant ssh to.

## ✅ Step 5: Passwordless SSH Setup

### 🔐 Scenario 1: Host → VM (Passwordless)

#### Step 5.1: Generate SSH Key (if needed)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
Just press enter until it successfully created it.

#### Step 5.2: Copy generated SSH Key to VMs, using this command from your Host

Use Git bash if you have it installed
```bash
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 your_username@127.0.0.1
# Do the same for the other node
```

Use powershell if you don't have bash installed
```bash
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh your_username@localhost -p 2222 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
# Do the same for the other node
````
#### Step 5.3: Test SSH from you HOST to VMs

```bash
ssh -p 2222 your_username@127.0.0.1 # head >> if successful, type exit
ssh -p 2223 your_username@127.0.0.1 # node1 >> if successful, type exit
```

---

### 🔁 Scenario 2: head → node1 (Internal Cluster Access)

#### Step 5.4: Generate Key on `head`

```bash
ssh -p 2222 your_username@127.0.0.1
ssh-keygen
```

#### Step 5.5: Copy to `node1`

```bash
ssh-copy-id your_username@10.0.2.5
```

#### Step 5.6: Test Passwordless from head to node1

```bash
ssh your_username@10.0.2.5
```
